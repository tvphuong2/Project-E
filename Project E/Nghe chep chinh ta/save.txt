<div id="l0" style="">Hello</div><div id="l1" style="">Hi</div><div id="l2" style=""> It's Laura Carlton here</div><div id="l3" style=""> We've just arrived at the holiday flat, but I can't get the hot water and heating to work</div><div id="l4" style="">Oh right</div><div id="l5" style=""> That's easy</div><div id="l6" style=""> Don't worry</div><div id="l7" style="">In the upstairs cupboard, you'll find the water heater</div><div id="l8" style=""> You'll see three main controls on the left at the bottom of the heater</div><div id="l9" style=""> The first one - the round one on the far left - is the most important one for the heating and hot water</div><div id="l10" style=""> It's the main control switch</div><div id="l11" style=""> Make sure it's in the 'on' position</div><div id="l12" style=""> The switch itself doesn't light up, but the little square below will be black if the switch is off</div><div id="l13" style=""> That's probably what's happened - it's got switched off by mistake</div><div id="l14" style=""> The middle one of these three controls - you'll see it's slightly larger than the first one – controls the radiators</div><div id="l15" style=""> If you feel cold while you're there and need the radiators on, this needs to be turned to maximum</div><div id="l16" style=""> The last of the three controls – the one on the right - is usually on about a number four setting which for the water in the taps is usually quite hot enough</div><div id="l17"> Below the healing controls in the middle is a small round Plastic button</div><div id="l18" style=""> If there isn't enough water in the pipes, sometimes the heater goes out</div><div id="l19" style=""> If this happens you'll need to press this button to reset the heater</div><div id="l20" style=""> Hold it in for about five seconds and the heater should come on again</div><div id="l21" style=""> Then there's a little square indicator under the third knob that's a kind of alarm light</div><div id="l22" style=""> It’ll flash if you need to reset the heater</div><div id="l23" style="">It sounds complicated</div><div id="l24" style="">I'm sure you won't have any problems with it</div><div id="l25" style=""> There should be some more instructions on the side of the heater</div><div id="l26" style=""> Call me back if you can’t make it work</div><div id="l27">Okay</div><div id="l28">While you're on the phone, we haven't managed to find a few things we need, like extra pillows for the beds and some washing powder</div><div id="l29"> Is there any here</div><div id="l30">Pillows yes</div><div id="l31"> If you look in the cupboard, the large white one upstairs - to the left of the bathroom door - there should be four or five on the top shelf</div><div id="l32"> And if you want to do some washing, there's some powder for that ……probably by the back door</div><div id="l33"> There's a kind of shelf there above the sink</div><div id="l34"> In fact, I'm sure there's some there, in a large blue box</div><div id="l35"> You need about half a cup full for each wash</div><div id="l36">And that reminds me, the spare key to the back door is hanging on a hook on the wall by the sitting room window</div><div id="l37"> Please make sure to put it back when you've used it</div><div id="l38"> The previous guests lost it in the garden and I had to get another one made</div><div id="l39"> And if you have any trouble with the lamps, you'll find some spare bulbs in a large cardboard box</div><div id="l40"> It's on top of the washing machine with all kinds of useful things in it</div><div id="l41">Oh, and another thing I forgot to mention when we last spokeYes</div><div id="l42">I’ve left you a local map, so you'll be able to find your way around easily</div><div id="l43"> It shows the whole area</div><div id="l44"> I put it in the top drawer of the chest under the TV in your bedroom</div><div id="l45"> There's a whole file of local information in there too</div><div id="l46">Thanks</div><div id="l47"> What about visiting the town</div><div id="l48"> Can you give us any advice</div><div id="l49">Yes</div><div id="l50"> You'll need to take the car</div><div id="l51"> It's too far to walk from the flat really</div><div id="l52"> You have to pay to leave your car in all the car parks now I'm afraid I like the one that's by the station best and you can walk to the town centre from there in five minutes</div><div id="l53"> That's where all the best restaurants are</div><div id="l54"> But if you want a takeaway, the Italian one does really good pasta and pizzas</div><div id="l55"> Call 7-3 double 2</div><div id="l56">8-1 for that one, or 7 double 6, double 1</div><div id="l57"> 9 for the Chinese</div><div id="l58"> They're both good and they'll both deliver to the flat</div><div id="l59"> As for places to visit, yes, do go and see the railway museum</div><div id="l60"> The exhibition is small but really good</div><div id="l61"> It gets very crowded on Sundays, so I suggest you visit it on a quieter day, later in the week, but not on Thursdays which is market day - you won't find anywhere to park and it's also the only day of the week when they're not open</div><div id="l62"> Anything else</div><div id="l63">Not for the moment</div><div id="l64"> Thanks</div><div id="l65"></div>%break%<div id="r0">Hello </div><div id="r1">Hi </div><div id="r2"> It's <b>Laural</b> <b>Cauten</b> here </div><div id="r3"><b>we</b> just <b>arived</b> at the holiday flat but i can't get <b>a</b> hot water and heating to work </div><div id="r4">oh right, </div><div id="r5"> that's easy. </div><div id="r6"> don't worry, </div><div id="r7">in the <b>upstair</b> cupboard you'll find <b>a</b> water heater. </div><div id="r8"> you'll see three main controls on the left at the bottom of the heater </div><div id="r9"> the first one, ... the round one on the far left, ... is ... important <b>want</b> <b>to</b> heating and hot water. </div><div id="r10"> it's the main control <b>swich</b> </div><div id="r11"> make sure it's in the <b>on</b> <b>posision.</b> </div><div id="r12"> the <b>swiches</b> <b>self</b> doesn't light up but <b>a</b> <b>litte</b> square below will be black if the <b>swich</b> is off </div><div id="r13"><b>that</b> <b>probaly</b> what's <b>happend</b> <b>it</b> got <b>swich</b> <b>stop</b> by mistake </div><div id="r14"> the middle one of <b>there</b> three controls -
